--to do before applying--
[ ]meta tags


--js--
[ ]add comments
[ ]clean up class names




--CSS--
[ ]make record walk and walk details look more different


--media breaks--
[ ]how does it look when phone rotates? check that

--bugs--
[ ]when you press enter inside the notes, you get an error message
[x]walk length and walk notes on form are slightly wider than the rest
[x]when you click on date, console log still shows prior date. 
    - when this is fixed, should also be able to update to only use isEditing in conditional render

[ ]turn doesWalkExist into a hook
[ ]create back end
[ ]reporting data
[ ]flesh out validation to create individual error states and messages
[ ]make walk behavior more visible (different color pawprints, maybe different color backgrounds on walk days)
[ ]add different functionality - dog mood, training sessions, play dates, hikes
