# Dog Walk Diary

## Currently (updated 4/6/2021)
- moving walk information from local storage to full back end
- planning new features
- planning reporting functionality

## Why this app?

I have a dog who is reactive on lead, but his behavior seems to vary wildly from one day to the next. Some walks, he's an angel. Other walks, he's barking at everything that moves. I wanted to create an app that allows me to track our walks in hopes of identifying patterns. Is he more reactive in the evening? Is he better behaved on longer walks? I hope this app helps me gain additional insight into my perfect, but complicated, dog.
